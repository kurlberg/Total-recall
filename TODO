* JAVE TODO

 - not every single page needs saving, for example dont save w3m
   buffers that you only look at for a second before killing

 - save a little bit of context(like which projects are active atm)

* TODO

 - Privacy implication: should files in ~/.total-recall be encrypted?
   Having your complete browsing history "public" might not be
   desirable - what if someone found out that you've been hanging out
   at www.vim.org!?
